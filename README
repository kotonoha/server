Kotonoha is a yet another flashcard software for learning japanese words.

Unlike anki, it is specialized only for japanese and has focus on quick new word addition.

When you create a server the admin account is created automatically.
Default username/password is admin@(none) / admin,
but you can change them or setup in a configuration file.
